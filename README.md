# Plex

Plex is a simple language, like Lua with some Ocaml feels. It is based on a notion of objects as extensible records. And since "everything is an object", a value may behave simultaneously as an integer, boolean, or a function.

It's inspired by [Andrej Bauer's Boa](http://www.andrej.com/plzoo/html/boa.html), but Plex aims to be more functional. Plex variabes are actually bindings, so it defaults to immutability. As in Ocaml, a list is an immutable, finite sequence of elements of the same type. As in Ocaml, there are imperative programming constructs such as `for` and `while` loops and also `ref` for getting a reference to mutable data.

Plex supports eager evaluation, optional lazy evaluation, first-class functions, and dynamic types. Where possible, Plex tries to checks type integrity of programs statically -- that is, at compile time.

_Work in Progress_

## Examples

See the test directory for example code that works

## Building and running

- Install [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

- Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rpip/plex.git && cd plex
$ mix ecscript.build
```

## Run a file

`$ ./plex test/examples/hello.plx`

## REPL

Plex includes a simple REPL, which you can play around with:

```bash
$ ./plex
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10]
Plex (0.0.1)
/h   - Print this help message
/q   - Exit the REPL
/lex - Tokenize code
/pp  - Tokenize and parse code
plex> let x = 3 with fn y -> y + 10
<Val x>
plex> x + 1
4
plex> x 2
12
plex> let x = 10 in (fn -> x + 1)
11
plex> let person = {name=nil, age=0}
<Record person>
plex> let ama = person with {name="Ama", age=20}
<Record person>
plex> ama.name
Ama
plex> let ama = ama with {age=18}
plex> ama.age
18
plex> let greet = fn name -> print "Hello #{name}"
<Func greet>
plex> greet "Joe"
Hello Joe
```

## Test Suite

To run the automated test suite:

`$ mix test`

### Windows

  1. Download and install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win.
  2. Download and install elixir from http://elixir-lang.org/install.html in order to use mix.
  3. Start git bash from command line. You can search for it from the windows start menu as well.
  4. Type the following in git bash:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rpip/plex && cd plex
$ mix escript.build
$ ./plex test/hello.plx
$ ./plex
Plex (0.0.1)
/help - Print this help message
/quit - Exit the REPL
/lex  - Tokenize code
/pp   - Tokenize and parse code
plex (1)>
```

  

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add plex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:plex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure plex is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:plex]]
        end
